For my image.c I used the formula provided to find the location of the R G and B values. In the create image function I malloced the individual R G and B values and multiplied them by the width and height. I also malloced the sizeof the image. I freed all of these individually in my freeImage method. For crop, I made a new image with the new width and height and copied the values from the old image using a for loop. For resize, I took the average of an amount of pixels that related to percent and put that average in either a smaller or larger group of pixels based on if we were making the image bigger or smaller. For brightness and contrast, I just used the formula provided and checked if the values were in bounds. For watermark, I allocated space for a new watermark image and compared the values of the watermark and normal image to see if I would need to multiply by 1.45. I also used the modulo operator incase the watermark was too small.
